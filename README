Curses::Widgets Module for Perl
==============================

Author: Arthur Corliss
Date:  December 5, 2001

Description:
------------

High level access to basic Curses widgets and related functions.

NOTE:  This is **NOT** backwards compatible with the pre-1.99 versions.  This
is entirely OO-based, hence any older scripts relying on the old versions will
need to be rewritten.

Also note that certain "widgets" are no longer available (i.e., the dialogs).
Those are more properly forms, not widgets, and hence will be available in the
upcoming Curses::Forms update.


Requirements:
-------------

--(n)Curses libraries
--Curses module

Instructions:
-------------

All that one needs to do is:

	perl Makefile.pl
	make test
	make install

Documentation for using the module is available if one types the following:

	perldoc Curses::Widgets
